/**
 * Max Binary Heap
 *
 * - A Binary Heap is a tree that can be represented as an array
 *   - For each "node", a node's value is greater than all nodes in its left and right child trees
 *   - It's always a "Complete Binary Tree"
 *     - Meaning all children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
 *   - For an array index n, its left child is stored at 2n + 1 and its right child at 2n + 2
 *     - e.g. For second node at index 1, its left child is at index 3 and its right at 4.
 * - Uses:
 *   - Easily/quickly find the node with the largest value
 *     - There are also Min Heaps which work for the smallest value
 *   - Implementing Priority Queues
 * - Time Complexities:
 *   - Removing an item: O(1)
 * - Resources:
 *   - https://btholt.github.io/four-semesters-of-cs-part-two/heap-sort/
